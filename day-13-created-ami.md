# Day 13 – AMI Creation

## What I did
- Created an AMI from the EC2 instance `xfusion-ec2`
- Named the AMI `xfusion-ec2-ami`
- Verified the AMI reached the Available state

## What I learned
- Like a blueprint, that contains the operating system, applications,
- and settings needed to launch an Amazon EC2 instance (a virtual server)
- AMI is a reusable image of an EC2 instance
- AMIs are used for backups and cloning servers
- New EC2 instances can be launched from an AMI
- AMI creation takes time and must reach Available state before use

## Proof of Work: Created an AMI
- You can see its name and status as available
