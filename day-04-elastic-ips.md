# Day 04 – Elastic IP

## What I did
- Allocated an Elastic IP address
- Added a Name tag `datacenter-eip`
- Created it in the us-east-1 region

## What I learned
- Elastic IP provides a static public IPv4 address
- Normal EC2 public IPs change on stop/start
- Elastic IPs can be attached or detached from instances
- Unused Elastic IPs can incur cost in real AWS accounts

## One doubt
- When should Elastic IPs be avoided in real architectures?

## Proof of Work: Created Elastic IPs
