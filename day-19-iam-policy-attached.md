# Day 19 – IAM Policy Attachment

## What I did
- Attached the IAM policy `iampolicy_siva` to the IAM user `iamuser_siva`

## What I learned
- IAM policies define permissions
- IAM users gain permissions only when a policy is attached
- Policies can be attached directly to users or via groups
- Attaching a policy immediately applies permissions to the user

## One-line rule
> IAM users can do nothing until a policy is attached.
