# Day 16 – IAM User

## What I did
- Created an IAM user named `iamuser_rose`

## What I learned
- IAM is Identity and Access Management
- IAM users are identities, not resources
- IAM users represent people or applications in AWS
- IAM users do not have permissions by default
- Permissions are granted using policies
- IAM is used to control access to AWS resources securely

## Proof of Work: Created IAM user named - iamuser_rose
