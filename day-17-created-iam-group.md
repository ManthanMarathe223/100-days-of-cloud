# IAM Group – Day 16

## What I did
- Created an IAM group named `iamgroup_yousuf`

## What I learned
- IAM groups are used to manage permissions for multiple users
- Groups can exist without any permissions
- Permissions are assigned to groups using policies
- Users inherit permissions from the groups they belong to

## One-line rule
> Use IAM groups to manage access for many users easily.

## Proof of work: Created IAM group without any permissions
