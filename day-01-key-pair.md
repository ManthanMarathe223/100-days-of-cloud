# Day 01 – EC2 Key Pair

## What I did
- Created an EC2 key pair named datacenter-kp
- Used RSA key type
- Created it in us-east-1 region

## What I learned
- AWS uses key-based login instead of passwords
- Key pairs are required to access EC2 instances securely
- IAM users have limited and temporary access

## One doubt
- How does AWS verify this key during EC2 login?
