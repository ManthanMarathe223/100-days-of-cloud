# Day 14 – EC2 Termination

## What I did
- Terminated the EC2 instance `xfusion-ec2`
- Waited until the instance reached the Terminated state

## What I learned
- EC2 instances have a defined lifecycle
- Terminated instances cannot be recovered
- Cleaning up resources is critical to avoid unnecessary costs
- Cloud resources should be created and destroyed as needed

## Proof of Work: 
- You can view the instance state as terminated
